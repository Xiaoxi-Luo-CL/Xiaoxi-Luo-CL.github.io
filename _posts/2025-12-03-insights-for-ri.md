Our approach provides a novel way to find evidence to understand the past phonological status and therefore the ways that they can change.

We conduct a case study on the 日 category to demonstrate some promising points.

The reconstruction of the 日 category has been a challenge in Chinese historical phonology, 
mainly because its pronunciation in different dialects vary a lot.
