Greetings! I am a master's student in the [CompLING Lab](https://compling-wat.com/) at [UWaterloo CS](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Freda Shi](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/), and currently affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Data Science at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies, I also received systematic training in Andient Chinese and Chinese Lingusitics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of linguistics and computation, broadly in two directions. I study how LLMs acquire, represent, and use linguistic knowledge, often using interpretability tools. I also build mathematical or computational models for
linguistics problems, e.g.: formalizing complex linguistics phenomena, proposing or verifying linguistics theories. 
With an expertise in Ancient Chinese, I am also particularly interested in diacronic language change and (computational) historical linguistics.
