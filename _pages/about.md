Greetings! I am a master's student in the [CompLING Lab](https://compling-wat.com/) at [UWaterloo CS](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Freda Shi](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/), and currently affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Data Science at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies, I pursued systematic training in Ancient Chinese and Chinese Linguistics in addition to my major. I also work closely with [Prof. Weiwei Sun](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ws390/) at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of computation and linguistics, primarily developing along two directions. One line is building mathematical or computational models for linguistics problems, e.g., formalizing complex phenomena, proposing or verifying theories. Another line focuses on understanding how LLMs acquire, represent, and use language with interpretability tools. These two lines share a common goal: to uncover the inner structures and rules of language, and to understand how they emerge and evolve in both human languages and LLMs.

With an expertise in Ancient Chinese, I am especially attracted by topics related to diachronic language change and (computational) historical linguistics.
